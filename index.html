                <p>
                 Born and raised in Texas with all the love and support I could ask for. I grew up rather quite but observant, <br> mostly only speaking when I was spoken too and even then, reluctantly.<br>
                 Though I did tend to get along with most of my peers, I prefered to stay indoors and around the familiar. <br> I spent my growing years on a competitve gymnastics team and teaching myself guitar <br>
                 this took up most of my time as I was entirely <em>too cool for school</em>.
